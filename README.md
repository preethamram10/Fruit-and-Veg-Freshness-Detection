# Fruit-and-Veg-Freshness-Detection
This repository uses TensorFlow/Keras to classify fruits and vegetables as fresh or rotten across 20 classes. It features MobileNetV2 for efficient feature extraction and a custom classification head. Data augmentation ensures robustness. The trained model is saved as `fruit_veg_freshness_model.h5` for future use or deployment.
